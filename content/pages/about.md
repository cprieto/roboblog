Hi, my name is Cristian Prieto. I am a software developer living in Berlin, Germany. During all these years I have been working in many different things, from operating system kernel drivers to mobile applications and web stuff.

I love system internals, agile development practices, open source development, history and cats (as you can guess from my blog!). This is my personal space and I use it to vent out things around my head, so it doesn't represent the point of view of my employer or all those things.

You can check what I have been working in my [github repository](http://github.com/cprieto) or what I am rambling about in my [twitter account](http://twitter.com/cprieto).
