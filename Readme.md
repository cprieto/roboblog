# This is my personal blog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cprieto/roboblog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cprieto/roboblog)

Well, not really, but this is the source code, configuration and everything else for my personal blog at [cprieto.com](http://cprieto.com).

It is made with the awesome static site generator [Pelican](http://getpelican.com).

To install, first install all the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And well, generate the blog using the fab file:

```bash
fab build
```

It uses a custom theme, if you like the theme just drop me a line and I will put it appart in its own repository ;)

Cheers!
